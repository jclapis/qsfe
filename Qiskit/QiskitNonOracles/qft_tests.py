        # Okay. So this algorithm is going to look weird at first considering it has nothing to do with
		# sine waves, and that's fine. I'm going to walk you through how I designed this, step by step.
		# Hopefully you can learn something from it and use it to design your own circuits for weird
		# qubit states!
		# 
		# The original classical array for 8 measurements over 1 second of the sine wave is this:
		# [0, 1/√2, 1, 1/√2, 0, -1/√2, -1, -1/√2]
		# 
		# We want to encode that into the real component of the amplitudes of a 3 qubit register, so we
		# get this:
		# 0*|000⟩ + 1/√2|001⟩ + 1*|010⟩ + 1/√2*|011⟩ + 0*|100⟩ - 1/√2*|101⟩ - 1*|110⟩ - 1/√2*|111⟩
		# 
		# Immediately, there's a problem: these amplitudes are too big. Quantum state vectors need the
		# sum of squares to add to 1, and these add to:
		# 2*(1/√2)^2 + 2*1^2 + 2*(-1/√2)^2
		# = 2*1/2 + 2*1 + 2*1/2
		# = 4
		# So to fix this, we need to divide each state's probability by 4 (and thus, each state's
		# amplitude by √4 = 2.
		# This is the target state once it's been normalized:
		# 0*|000⟩ + 1/2√2*|001⟩ + 1/2*|010⟩ + 1/2√2*|011⟩ + 0*|100⟩ - 1/2√2*|101⟩ - 1/2*|110⟩ - 1/2√2*|111⟩
		# = 1/2( 1/√2*|001⟩ + |010⟩ + 1/√2*|011⟩ - 1/√2*|101⟩ - |110⟩ - 1/√2*|111⟩ )
		# 
		# Now that we have the target state, we can start designing a circuit for it.
		# The first thing I notice about the general structure of the state is that it's really in two
		# halves: when q0 = 0, it's 1/√2*|001⟩ + |010⟩ + 1/√2*|011⟩.
		# when q0 = 1, it's -1/√2*|101⟩ - |110⟩ - 1/√2*|111⟩.
		# The second half is just the negative version of the first half (with q0 flipped), so I know
		# 2 things:
		#		1. q0 isn't entangled with anything
		#		2. q0 is in an equal superposition of |0⟩ and |-1⟩.
		# Thus, we can reduce q0 to the |-⟩ state which is 1/√2*(|0⟩ - |1⟩). We know that whatever else
		# happens, we're going to put q0 into |-⟩ at the start of the circuit and ignore it after that.
		# Here's the reduction:
		# 1/2( 1/√2*|001⟩ + |010⟩ + 1/√2*|011⟩ - 1/√2*|101⟩ - |110⟩ - 1/√2*|111⟩ )
		# = 1/2( √2*1/√2( 1/√2*|001⟩ + |010⟩ + 1/√2*|011⟩ - 1/√2*|101⟩ - |110⟩ - 1/√2*|111⟩ ) )
		# = 1/2( √2( 1/√2*|-01⟩ + |-10⟩ + 1/√2*|-11⟩ ) )
		# = 1/2( |-01⟩ + √2*|-10⟩ + |-11⟩ )
		# 
		# Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Next, I notice that when q2 is 1, q1 has an equal
		# probability of being |0⟩ or |1⟩. It might be more obvious if I rearrange the terms like this:
		# = 1/2( |-01⟩ + |-11⟩ + √2*|-10⟩ )
		# 
		# In other words, when q2 is 1, q1 = |+⟩ which is 1/√2*(|0⟩ + |1⟩). Let's use that to reduce the
		# qubit state even further:
		# 1/2( |-01⟩ + |-11⟩ + √2*|-10⟩ )
		# = 1/2( √2*1/√2( |-01⟩ + |-11⟩ ) + √2*|-10⟩ )
		# = 1/2( √2( |-+1⟩ ) + √2*|-10⟩ )
		# = √2/2( |-+1⟩ + |-10⟩ )
		# = 1/√2( |-+1⟩ + |-10⟩ )
		#
		# This is as far as the reduction can go. You might think that you can reduce q2 into |+⟩ here,
		# but note that the state of qubit 1 changes depending on what qubit 2 is. That means we can't
		# reduce it; it also means that q1 and q2 are going to be entangled.
		# Anyway, now that the state is reduced, we can figure out how to create the states with a
		# circuit. We know that q0 is going to be |-⟩ no matter what, so that's easy: X and H will put
		# it into that state, and then we can ignore it. The other two qubits are then described by
		# this state:
		# 1/√2( |+1⟩ + |10⟩ )
		# 
		# q2 has an equal probability of being |0⟩ or |1⟩ (probability 1/√2), so it can just be prepared
		# with a simple H.
		# Now for q1, the weird one: assuming it starts at |0⟩, then if q2 == 1, q1 should be Hadamard'd.
		# If q2 == 0, then q1 should be flipped instead. That's actually pretty easy to do: we can just
		# do a Controlled H with q2 as the control and q1 as the target, and a zero-controlled X (AKA a
		# 0-CNOT) with q2 as the control and q1 as the target. We just have to make sure q2 is H'd first.
		# 
		# And thus, at the end of the day, this is how you construct a 3-qubit state where the real part
		# of the amplitudes maps to a 1 Hz sine wave, sampled at 8 samples per second:

        # Set up q0
        circuit.x(qubits[0])
        circuit.h(qubits[0])

        # Set up q2
        circuit.h(qubits[2])

        # Set up q1: if q2 is 1, H it. Otherwise, X it.

        circuit.x(qubits[2])
        circuit.cx(qubits[2], qubits[1])
        circuit.x(qubits[2])

        # I hope that writeup helped explain how these 7 lines create the sine wave, and help you do
		# circuit design like this in the future!

		# out a circuit to generate the state you're looking for. The process for this one is the same,
		# so this is just going to be another example of it. I'll walk you through it.
		# 
		# First things first: here's the conventional array of samples from cos(2πx) that you'd normally
		# feed into DFT:
		# [1, 1/√2, 0, -1/√2, -1, -1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

		# 
		# There aren't any immediately obvious patterns with respect to the + and - parts (or at least,
		# I couldn't find any), so I just reorganized it a little bit to group the common parts together:
		# 1/2( |000⟩ - |100⟩ + 1/√2( |001⟩ - |011⟩ - |101⟩ + |111⟩ ) )
		# 
		# Now with this, I do notice a commonality. In the first 2 terms, q2 is always 0. In the last 4
		# terms (the 1/√2 group), q2 is always 1. Both groups have a 50% chance of occurring, so really
		# we could break it down into this algorithm:
		#		H(q2)
		#		if(q2 == 0), put q0 and q1 in the first group
		#		else, put q0 and q1 into the second group
		# Obviously we can't perform a classical "if-else" on qubits in superpositions... but we CAN
		# leverage the Controlled functor which effectively does the same thing!
		# So, with that in mind, let's figure out how to create the groups.
		# 
		# The first group is just [|00⟩ - |10⟩]0⟩, which reduces to √2*|-00⟩. That's easy to write a
		# circuit for: we just do X and H on q0 to put it into the |-⟩ state. So for the first group,
		# we can do this:
		#		if(q2 == 0)... (the gates below will be zero-controlled on q2)
		#		X(q0);
		#		H(q0);
		# 
		# The second group is a little harder: [|00⟩ - |01⟩ - |10⟩ + |11⟩]1⟩. Written as a state vector
		# of q0 and q1, it looks like this: [1, -1, -1, 1]. We need some way to get the qubits into
		# this state. I did a little reverse engineering on it: we know that H on both qubits will give
		# the state [1, 1, 1, 1]. There are 2 negative phases, and we know that Z on q0 would give the
		# state [-1, 1, -1, 1]; Z on q1 would give [1, -1, 1, -1]. We could do either of those but we'd
		# need a way to swap the 1st and 2nd qubits, or the 3rd and 4th terms, respectively.
		# Wait! We have one! CNOT on q0 and q1 will swap the 3rd and 4th terms! So to get this state,
		# we could do the following:
		#		if(q2 == 1)... (the gates below will be controlled on q2)
		#		H(q0);
		#		H(q1);
		#		Z(q1);
		#		CNOT(q0, q1);
		#
		# Finally, note that the last operation of the first group is H(q0) and the first operation of
		# the second group is H(q0), so we can just remove that step from both groups and perform it
		# unconditionally in-between their execution.
		# 
		# You can verify that the amplitudes of each state work out with this setup. I wrote it up below,
		# and lo and behold, it produced the cosine measurement array. I'm sure there's a prettier way to
		# do this that looks more like the sine function, but this is meant to be another good example of
