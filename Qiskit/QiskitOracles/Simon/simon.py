# This file contains the implementation and test oracles for Simon's Problem.
# This is a very math-heavy problem that requires a lot of work to prove
# properly, but here's the best basic explanation I can come up with:
# 
# Let's say you have a function F that takes in a bit string (an array of
# 0s and 1s), of size N. It produces an output of size N too. So if you give it
# a 3-bit string, it will give you back a 3-bit string.
# 
# In this function, every possible output has exactly two inputs that produce it
# (call them A and B). So F(A) = F(B), and A != B. No other input produces that
# specific output; just A and B. There is a pair like this for every single output
# value. F is what is called a "two-to-one" function in this case, because every
# output has a pair of inputs that produce it.
# 
# Now, what makes this function special is that it has a secret bit string inside
# it, also of size N. Let's call it "S" for "secret". If A and B are a pair that
# produce the same output, then A ⊕ B = S (where ⊕ means XOR). Doesn't matter which
# pair it is, doesn't matter which output it is. Any pair A and B will give you S
# when XOR'd. this also means A ⊕ S = B, and B ⊕ S = A.
#
# That's a lot of abstract nonsense, so here are two examples to help visualize
# what this is talking about.
#
# Here are two functions that match the description above, where N = 3:
# Input | Output				Input | Output
# --------------				--------------
#  000	|  000					 000  |  101
#  001  |  000					 001  |  010
#  010  |  001					 010  |  000
#  011  |  001					 011  |  110
#  100  |  010					 100  |  000
#  101  |  010					 101  |  110
#  110  |  011					 110  |  101
#  111  |  011					 111  |  010
# 
# In the first function, S = 001. You can check this yourself; take any two
# inputs that produce the same output (like 100 and 101), and check that one
# XOR'd with 001 produces the other. 100 ⊕ 001 = 101, etc. This works for any
# pair of inputs that have the same output.
# The same is true of the second function, where S = 110. For example,
# the inputs 010 and 100 both produce the output 000. 010 ⊕ 110 = 100.
#
# (There's a special case if S = 000 where things get weird, but that just means
# the function is one-to-one instead of two-to-one and will be explained later.)
# 
# Now, normally, you have to do something like (2^N)/2 queries to find a pair
# that produced the same output so you could XOR them together and get S.
# Thus the problem on a classical computer is O(2^N). Simon's Algorithm is
# a way to do it with a quantum computer that is more like O(N) or O(N^2)
# depending on how you end up implementing it.
# 
# This is one of the first problems to be explored that offers a real, nontrivial
# quantum speedup on problems that would take exponential time on a classical
# computer. At first it was regarded as a "toy" problem like Deutsch-Jozsa, but
# lately it's been finding some real use cases in cryptography so it's worth
# learning.
# 
# As a final note, this is a hybrid algorithm kind of like Shor's: it does some
# classical preprocessing, runs a quantum component, then does some classical
# postprocessing to get the answer. It isn't exclusively a quantum thing like
# many of these tests.

def simon_quantum_step(function, input_size):
    """
    Performs the quantum portion of Simon's algorithm, by finding an input
	string X where (X · S) % 2 = 0 (AKA x0*s0 ⊕ x1*s1 ⊕ ... ⊕ xN*sN = 0).

    Parameters:
        function (function): The black-box function to run the algorithm on (the function being
	        evaluated). It should take a QuantumCircuit as its first input, an input QuantumRegister
            as its second argument, and an output QuantumRegister as its third argument.

        input_size (int): The number of bits that the function expects in its input and output
	        registers.

    Returns:
        A bit string representing the measured result of the function. This bit
	    string is a vector X where (X · S) % 2 = 0. Note that this will be the
	    measured result of the INPUT register after it's been evaluated. The OUTPUT
	    register is thrown away, because it doesn't actually matter to the algorithm
	    at all.

    Remarks:
        A lot of literature out there will say that this returns a string where
	    s · x = 0. This is misleading, because what they really mean is
	    "dot product mod-2" and they don't usually say the "mod-2" part.
	    Basically, this finds an input value that, when dot product'd with S,
	    gives an even number.
