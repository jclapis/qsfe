# This file contains the implementation for the quantum part of Shor's algorithm.
# This is the world-famous algorithm developed by Peter Shor way back in 1994
# that breaks asymmetric cryptography and is one of the main drivers behind
# quantum computing. Essentially, it figures out the prime factors of numbers in
# something like O(log(N)^2) instead of O(e^2N) which is a massive speedup. Like
# Simon's Problem, this one is a hybrid algorithm that has a quantum part and a
# classical part.

    # Some background on what this step of the algorithm does:
	# Any rational number can be represented by the fraction P/Q, where
	# P and Q are integers. This can also be represented as what's called
	# a continued fraction, which is a number of the form
	# a_0 + 1/(a_1 + 1/(a_2 + 1/(a_3 + ...))).
	# The terms a_i here are called the coefficients.
	# Calculating the convergents is easy with an iterative process:
	# set P_0 = P, Q_0 = Q
	# a_i = P_i / Q_i;		<== Coefficient
	# r_i = P_i % Q_i;		<== Remainder
	# P_i+1 = Q_i;
	# Q_i+1 = r_i;
	# When r_i == 0, this is the last term in the continued fraction.
	# 
	# Continued fractions have things called convergents, which are
	# versions of the fraction but only with i coefficients. Essentially they
	# are closed and closer approximations to the full continued fraction.
	# So if we call
	# v_0 the first convergent, they look like this:
	# v_0 = a_0
	# v_1 = a_0 + 1/a_1
	# v_2 = a_0 + 1/(a_1 + 1/a_2)
	# v_3 = a_0 + 1/(a_1 + 1/(a_2 + 1/a_3)) ...
	# For any convergent, the numerator and denominator will both be integers.
	# The math works out so that for the i-th convergent, you can easily
	# calculate the numerator (n_i) and the denominator (d_i):
	# n_i = a_i * n_(i-1) + n_(i-2)
	# d_i = a_i * d_(i-1) + d_(i-2)
	# 
	# Shor's algorithm finds the convergent of the fraction |X>' / N, where

	# number of possible states in the X register, with the largest
	# denominator less than B (the original number being factored).

    # Essentially, this works by converting modular exponentiation into a bunch of modular
	# multiplications. It will take n multiplications (where n is the length of the input
	# register). If the input is a uniform superposition, then it will contain 2^n possible states,
	# all of which will be calculated at the same time by this function. Thus, this offers an
	# exponential quantum speedup over classical computation.
	# 
	# The reason this works is kind of mathy, and it's not hard to explain but it does require a lot
	# of math notation which is really hard to write in code comments. Nevertheless, here goes...
	# 
	# Basically you can represent any number in binary, where each digit is a power of 2.
	# Take 13 for example. 13 in big-endian binary is 1101, which = 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0.
	# Since you're a developer reading this code, I'm going to assume you understand how binary works.
	# So the expression A^X mod B can be rewritten by expanding X into its binary form:
	# A^X mod B = ( (A^X_0*2^n-1 mod B) * (A^X_1*2^n-2 mod B) * ... * (A^X_n-1*2^0 mod B) ) mod B.
	# When X_i == 0, the term is ignored. When X_i == 1, the term becomes A^2^(n-i-1) mod B.
	# Essentially that means we can do a modular multiplication for each term, and just use the bits of X
	# as controls for it. A^2^(n-i-1) is easy for a classical computer to calculate, so basically this
	# implements quantum modular exponentiation by turning it into a bunch of quantum modular
	# multiplications and classical modular exponentiations. Since it only does n iterations of either one,
	# but can run on 2^n states simultaneously, this is a big win. 
	# 
	# This would normally be a fine way to calculate things if you had an input and output register,
	# but the Q# version of modular multiplication runs in-place which means it only has one register for
	# the input and output.
	# (Note: since Qiskit doesn't come with one of these functions, I ported Q#'s code over to Qiskit so I
	# can actually implement Shor's algorihtm).
	# This means we have to redo the equation a little bit which involves way too many parentheses to write
	# here, but the end result is the same: repeat the calculation |O> = |O> * c mod B for each qubit in
	# the input register, where X_i controls the multiplication and c = A^(2^(n-i-1)) mod B.

	# of states in the input register, so 2^Length(input) and i is an integer where
	# 0 <= i < P).

	# That's not going to make a lot of sense, so let me give you an example. Say the
	# number we want to factor is 21 and our guess is 11. 21 takes 5 bits to represent in
	# binary, so length(output) = 5 and length(input) = 10. Input has 2^10 = 1024 possible
	# states in it, so N = 1024. QFT will modify the input so all of the output values
	# will basically have zero probability except for P values, where P is the period
	# (in this case, 6). These values will be N * 0 / P, N * 1 / P ... N * (P-1) / P.
	# For the example, with 11^X mod 21, QFT will modify the states so these 6 have very
	# high probabilities:
	# 1024 * 0 / 6 = 0
	# 1024 * 1 / 6 = 170.666...
	# 1024 * 2 / 6 = 341.333...

	# 1024 * 4 / 6 = 682.666...
	# 1024 * 5 / 6 = 853.333...
	# 
	# The reason for this is way too hard to explain in code comments - you're going to
	# have to read some papers to understand why it does this. All you need to know is this
	# is what's going to happen. Anyway, since we're dealing with binary integers here, we
	# can't get these exact values. So when we measure X, it's going to be the closest integer
