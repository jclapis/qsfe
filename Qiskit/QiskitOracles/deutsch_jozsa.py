class DeutschJozsa(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    This class contains the implementation and tests for the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.
    It checks a given function f(x) that takes in a register and outputs a single bit,
    to see whether or not it's "constant" or "balanced". Constant means it always
    returns 0 (or always 1) for all possible inputs. Balanced means it returns 0 for
    half of the possible inputs and 1 for the other half.
    Normally this would take N/2 + 1 checks (N = the number of possible inputs) in order
    to prove with 100% certainty that the algorithm was one or the other, but the DJ
    algorithm takes advantage of the way the Hadamard gate works to cause quantum
    interference, which can produce the answer in only 1 check.

    This is a "toy" algorithm in the sense that it was invented by mathematicians as
    the first simple example of a problem that offers a speedup with quantum computers
    compared to classical computers, but it's a super contrived problem with no real
    practical applications.
